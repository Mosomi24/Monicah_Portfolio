      <p>My education journey began at Kebirigo Primary School, where I laid the foundation for my academic life. I later joined Rang'ala Girls High School in Nyamira County, where I continued to nurture my academic talents and develop leadership skills.</p>
      <p>Currently, I am a student at <strong>Zetech University</strong>, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. Here, I have gained a solid foundation in programming, web development, and system analysis, preparing me for a successful career in tech.</p>
