      <p>I was born in Kericho in the year 2000 and raised in the rural areas of Nyamira. As the firstborn of three children and the only girl in the family, I was brought up with strong values of prayer, discipline, and hard work.</p>
      <p>My curiosity and drive to learn were always encouraged by my parents, and I took my education seriously from a young age.</p>
